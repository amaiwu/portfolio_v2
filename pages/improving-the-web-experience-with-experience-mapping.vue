          <p class="ff-dm-serif fs-36 py-10">
            The Covid-19 pandemic meant no more in-person concerts for The
            Ontario Pops Orchestra (OPO)...
          </p>
          <p class="py-10">
            With concerts now online, the OPO felt there was an opportunity to
            reach a global audience. Using experience mapping, we uncovered
            impactful opportunities leading to a full redesign of the OPO
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I led the design of the experience map, which was important for
            pitching our ideas to the OPO and demistifying the UX process. I
            also worked as a designer for the website.

            The importance of talking to users cannot be over-emphasized. Not
            only did we improve the OPO website, but we helped the OPO learn
            about their audience. This was very rewarding!
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, working with clients new to UX design is a teaching
            opportunity. With experience mapping, it was easy to bring the OPO
            along the UX process, while serving to align our focus.
