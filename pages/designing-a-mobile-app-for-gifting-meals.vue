            Food donation beneficiaries are at the mercy of whatever food is
            donated. This means they may or may not like/enjoy what is being
            offered.
          </p>
          <p>
            To improve this experience, I designed a solution that would connect
            those in need of food (beneficiaries) to those willing to give
            (givers) while allowing beneficiaries create their own food menus.
            The outcome is a happy beneficiary and a giver who is confident that
            their gift will be appreciated.

            At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people were in need.
            I witnessed someone offer a homeless person food, which they
            rejected. This got me thinking about several things, one of which
            was
            <strong

            I envisioned a solution that would have an integration with a food
            delivery service, like UberEats. With such integration, the food
            delivery service would provide menu options and handle orders and
            deliveries (via APIs). On the other hand, the proposed solution will
            focus on connecting givers to beneficiaries, as well as allowing
            beneficiaries to curate their own menus.

            This was a concept project, hence I made assumptions regarding
            integrations with external food services like Ubereats. However, I
            learned good lessons, including the importance of user onboarding
            and it's role in setting the tone for a user's experience of a
            product. In addition, by working with the apple's human interface
            guidelines I learned best practices for designing mobile apps.
