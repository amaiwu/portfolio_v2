                Quora is a Q&A platform with a mission to share the world‚Äôs
                knowledge. All content types on quora (both long and short form
                content) contribute to this mission, however we noticed high
                quality short content did not get as much distribution on Quora
                like their long content counterparts.

                I explored comment previews as a way to increase user engagement
                on content, specifically short content. This resulted in a 10%
                increase in comment expands and comments from teammates
                suggested it made for a better feed experience.

                <p class="py-10">
                  Quora allows for both long and short-form content, however,
                  unlike long content, short content cannot be expanded. The
                  click interaction during expands is important for collecting
                  signals to learn about users preferences, which in turn
                  improves the prediction model. As short content did not need
                  to be expanded, it suffered some bias during content
                  distribution.

                <p class="py-10">
                  <strong>User research</strong> showed that some spaces did not
                  understand the value of their content, and seemed to associate
                  ‚Äúhigh quality content‚Äù with longer content. The world is
                  changing and everything is moving fast. Now more than ever
                  people are condensing brilliant tips and ideas into short
                  posts. It will be naive to assume that longer means better.

                  I built the variants in React, using colors and fonts from the

                  Unable to mitigate the impact on negative metrics when

                  In designing for ML-driven solutions, it is important to seek
                  ways to learn about the user. When design supports ML, it
                  makes for a more personalized user experience.

                  the user, especially when working closely with machine learning.
